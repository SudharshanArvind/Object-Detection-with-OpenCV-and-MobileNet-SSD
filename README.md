# Object-Detection-with-OpenCV-and-MobileNet-SSD
This project demonstrates a real-time object detection system using OpenCV and a pre-trained MobileNet-SSD model with the COCO dataset. The system captures video from a webcam, processes each frame to detect objects, and displays the detection results with bounding boxes and class labels.
